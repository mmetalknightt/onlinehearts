        30/5 - Joanne Robertson - Blue Car <br  />
        I came across this album after finding the BLUE CAR music video as a recommended video on YouTube, forgetting that JOANNE ROBERTSON worked on PUSHER w/ DEAN BLUNT, <br  />
        which I’d heard back in my 2nd year of university + after listening 2 this track, there’s no way that I couldn’t listen 2 the whole project. <br  />
        The album is very intimate. It felt lyk I was sitting in the pews of a church as she played it, wiv every line, guitar riff + chord soaked in heavy reverb (convolution reverb maybe? or just the large hall/space she was in, probably) <br  />
        IIRC, I read on the Bandcamp biography of the project that the purpose of each song was 2 capture how she was feeling emotionally that day <br  />
        + this made a lot of sense post-listen. A lot of the lyrics r unintelligible which suits itself + its intentions. <br  />
        Further 2 the point of the intimacy of these songs, I noticed that there were a lot “mistakes”, stutters + blunders left in which adds 2 the closeness of it. <br  />
        My favourite tracks r BLUE CAR, BAND SIT TOGETHER, IF IT FEELS, CROSSROADS, LITTLE TALKING DID U KNOW <br  />
